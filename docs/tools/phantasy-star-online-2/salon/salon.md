## NGS Salon Tool
A tool for handling PSO2 and NGS .**p (.mhp, .fnp, etc.) character files. Also fully supports NPC .cml/.eml files. Much of the data in these files can be edited outside of the game via this tool and a few extra options exist for enhanced functionality. For example, characters from the Japanese version that the Global release deems "below 150 cm", even if they're not, can be fixed. Errors from old conversions can be fixed and either character face slot can be imported onto. In addition, any part combinations may be selected, though the game will curate these upon loading them.
