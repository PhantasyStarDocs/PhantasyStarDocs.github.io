## Aqua Model Tool
A model focused tool with various functionalities. .aqe effects, all animation types, and motion config .bti files can all be edited alongside .aqp and .trp models. .prm and .prx models can be converted to and from their formats with this tool as well. It allows for batch conversion of all pso2 models to .fbx and a number of other, somewhat random, utility features, including converting pso1 terrain, psp/2/i .unj, and ps nova models to pso2 format, among other things.
