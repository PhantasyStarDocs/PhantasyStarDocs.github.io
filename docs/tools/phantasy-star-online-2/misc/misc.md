## Logue's NGS Tools
Tools focused around various things. As of this writing, NGS Packer, an ICE archive unpack and repacker, Color Tools, tools for previewing how character colors will affect each other, Region Map, a map of NGS with a number of fan tracked locations for items and other objects, and Screenshot tools, a tool for making transparent images based on a color from a green screen etc. Logue also seems have more on the way that may be usable at a later date.

## Aqua Model Tool
A model focused tool with various functionalities. It also converts to and from the game's .text format, can parse files in the game's VTBF format to txt for examining, can generate a language patch for the Japanese version by grafting together the Global and JP equivalent .text files, and can generate file spreadsheets as .csvs which detail the archives containing a number of important things in the game. It also has other random research functionality when compiled as debug.

## unluac
unluac is a lua 5.x decompiler. Phantasy Star Online 2 and Phantasy Star Nova use a hefty amount of .lua and should work well with this. An example .bat that decompiles ALL .lua files in its own folder and all folders below it can be found here, but must be edited to refereonce your PC's Java install directory. [decompall.bat](../../../assets/common/decompall.bat)
