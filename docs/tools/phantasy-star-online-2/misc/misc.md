## PSO2 Modding Discord
A discord server for discussing Phantasy Star Online 2 modding. Also open to discussing modding for other Phantasy Star games here. It's not the largest group and we'd like to be welcoming.

## Logue's NGS Tools
Tools focused around various things. As of this writing, NGS Packer, an ICE archive unpack and repacker, Color Tools, tools for previewing how character colors will affect each other, Region Map, a map of NGS with a number of fan tracked locations for items and other objects, and Screenshot tools, a tool for making transparent images based on a color from a green screen etc. Logue also seems have more on the way that may be usable at a later date.

## PSO2 Downloadable Sheets
A set of downloadable sheets generated by Aqua Model Tool that in theory list every possible character piece as well as lobby actions, mags, pets, classic photon blasts, dark blasts, vehicles, enemies, and weapons. There's also pixel data for classic pso2 color palettes. Separate sets are generated for JP and Global/NA clients. 
These may be more up to date in the Discord at times.

## PSO2 Extracted Ice File Lists
Text lists of the contents of every ICE file in the game except the 3 probably unused v3 ones (older extractors showed them to just contain dated icon textures). Also notes the file formats for every non ICE file in the game's data folder. Useful for hunting down things, particularly since most pso2 filenames are based on English.

The PS4 file lists aren't up to date, and can't be due to how PS4 file extraction works right now, however the names in these are unscrambled. This makes it not only easier to guess what things are, but how to guess other filenames as well.

## PSO2 File Directory and PSO2 High Risk file sheets by Key A/Arredoval
A spreadsheet set containing a number of classic pso2 items. These contain a large number of important file locations, many of which aren't reflected in newer sheet attempts. Most of it was made well before the usage of the PS4 version for automation and so there are many pleasant, human touches in the listings that the later sheets can't offer.

Particularly useful for classic pso2 area file and id info.

## PSO2 File Directory v3.0 Release by Frey
A spreadsheet set containing a number of classic pso2 items. It should be considered lower priority than other lists due to its accuracy, but has some things that others don't.

## Aqua Model Tool
A model focused tool with various functionalities. It also converts to and from the game's .text format, can parse files in the game's VTBF format to txt for examining, can generate a language patch for the Japanese version by grafting together the Global and JP equivalent .text files, and can generate file spreadsheets as .csvs which detail the archives containing a number of important things in the game. It also has other random research functionality when compiled as debug.

## unluac
unluac is a lua 5.x decompiler. Phantasy Star Online 2 and Phantasy Star Nova use a hefty amount of .lua and should work well with this. An example .bat that decompiles ALL .lua files in its own folder and all folders below it can be found here, but must be edited to refereonce your PC's Java install directory.
