## AET
Unclear use, but there's one for most animations. Data matches between all observed.

## CRBPJ
These seem to be for cropping images for UI elements.

## CRTTL
A file listing out tutorial texture filenames.

## CSV
Standard UTF16 csv. Open with Google Sheets or something.
In PS Nova, these are often parsed out from PSO2 metadata files pretty directly.

## MINI
Unknown, but small as the extension would imply. They correlate with area names.

## NOD
Node files? Perhaps related to object layouts given the area name correlation.

## RMD
Seems to be a file for text. Contains AIF textures, perhaps to store nonstandard text characters? The AIFs can often be empty.
