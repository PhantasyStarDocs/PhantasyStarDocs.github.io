# AFS
AFS files are archive formats used by many games. In the Phantasy Star series, PSO and PSU both use this format. While these can and do provide filenames in PSU, they should not be expected for PSO. 

While Tenora works works well for PSU, a tool such as the archaic AFS Explorer might work better for PSO as Tenora Works does not work especially well with a lack of filenames in an AFS.
